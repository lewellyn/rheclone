RHEL Clone Support Information and Scripts
==========================================

If you're using a clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, especially a clone
which is not CentOS, you're probably somewhat familiar with various rough
edges caused by things assuming things about your system which aren't
true... or worse, not assuming things because they don't see your system
as being nearly RHEL. The stuff in this repository may be useful to you.

Most of the contents have been tested on Scientific Linux 6.x and CentOS
6.x. Your mileage may vary on other clones or versions, but barring
any information listed to the contrary these things should work on any
reasonable clone.

```rhel-lsb_release.sh```: Intended for use as an alias to fool
things into thinking they're running on RHEL. Usage example: ```alias
lsb_release='/path/to/your/rhel-lsb_release.sh'``` More information:
